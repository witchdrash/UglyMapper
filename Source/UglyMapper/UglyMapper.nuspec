    <summary>A quick, trivial, object mapper. Allows you to map property to property, or call specific constructors. Safe for IOC, and refactoring.</summary>

    <releaseNotes>
      Found some IOC containers went into an infinite loop when trying to use the factory class with a mapping class that the factory class was injected into, this has led to a change in how the factory class is passed in to the mapping class.

      This means a class called from the factory class has access to its parent factory.
